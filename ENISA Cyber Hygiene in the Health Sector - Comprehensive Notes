  Service: Any
  Action: Deny
  Logging: Enabled

```
5. Monitoring and Maintenance:

A.3 Backup and Recovery Implementation Guide

Comprehensive Backup Strategy:
1. Backup Scope Definition:
What to Backup:
Critical Data (RPO: 1 hour, RTO: 4 hours):
- Electronic Health Records (EHR)
- Patient databases
- PACS images
- Laboratory results
- Pharmacy records
- Active patient care data
Important Data (RPO: 24 hours, RTO: 24 hours):
- Administrative databases
- Email systems
- Financial records
- HR records
- Scheduling systems
Standard Data (RPO: 7 days, RTO: 72 hours):
- Archived records
- Historical reports
- Non-critical applications
- User files
System Configurations (RPO: Weekly, RTO: Varies):
- Server configurations
- Network device configs
- Application settings
- Firewall rules
- Security policies
2. Backup Methods:
Full Backup:
- Complete copy of all data
- Frequency: Weekly (typically weekend)
- Longest time to complete
- Simplest to restore
- Highest storage requirement
Incremental Backup:
- Only changes since last backup (full or incremental)
- Frequency: Daily
- Fastest to complete
- Lowest storage requirement
- Slower to restore (need full + all incrementals)
Differential Backup:
- Changes since last full backup
- Frequency: Daily
- Moderate completion time
- Moderate storage requirement
- Faster restore than incremental (need full + latest differential)
3. 3-2-1-1-0 Backup Rule:
Modern Enhanced Rule:
- 3 copies of data (original + 2 backups)
- 2 different media types (disk + tape, or disk + cloud)
- 1 copy offsite (geographic separation)
- 1 copy offline or immutable (ransomware protection)
- 0 errors in backup verification

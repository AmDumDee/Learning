2. Methodology & Scope


Data Collection Framework

Sources
- Open-source intelligence (primary)
- Anonymized data from EU Member States
- ENISA Cyber Partnership Programme members
- EEAS STRATCOM (for FIMI analysis)
Limitations & Caveats
- Open-source reporting depth varies
- Temporal delays (cyberespionage campaigns: 6 months - 4+ years)
- Geographic/sectoral vagueness in some reports
- Audience interest influences reporting frequency
Quality Control
- Thorough dataset curation
- Single-sector categorization to avoid inflation

Analytical Approach

Attribution Standards
- Based on public attributions from national authorities
- Technical imputation by trusted private vendors
- Clear distinction between "nexus" and confirmed attribution
FIMI Methodology
- Sample limited to known Russian-linked operations
- Not representative of all FIMI activity
- Illustrative rather than comprehensive
